# Movie & TV Show Data
## Data
This project utilized ficticious data from the Netflix database stored [here](https://www.db-fiddle.com/f/pfsdrKi9cgCDp4Wwb77AF/0)

## SQL
-- For this project we will take a look at a ficticious database of movies & tv shows and use them to answer questions. 

-- first we'll take a look at how many movie titles there are in the database

SELECT count(title)
FROM netflix_titles_info AS titles
WHERE type = 'Movie'
;

-- next, we'll identify when the most recent batch of tvshows/movies were added to the database

SELECT max(date_added)
FROM netflix_titles_info AS titles
;

-- Now we're listing the movies/tv shows in alphabetical order

SELECT title
FROM netflix_titles_info 
ORDER BY title
;

-- Who was the Director for the movie The Starling?

SELECT title, director
FROM netflix_titles_info
LEFT JOIN netflix_people
ON netflix_titles_info.show_id = netflix_people.show_id
WHERE title = 'The Starling'


-- What is the oldest movie in the database and what year was it made?

SELECT release_year, title
FROM netflix_titles_info
WHERE type = 'Movie'
AND release_year <= (SELECT min(release_year) 
                     FROM netflix_titles_info
                    WHERE type = 'Movie')
;
